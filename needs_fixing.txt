MICHI:

echo hi | echo hi |
		->Invalid read of size 1

Syntax:

<<"asd" cat
	-> heredoc will not have "asd" as limitertoken, but cat. why?

/bin/cat <Makefile >
	ms: syntax error and afterwards -> cat makefile..
	bash: only syntax error

ls | cat Makefile | cat << "asd" > out
	works but not if it is like this:
ls|cat Makefile|cat<<"asd">out
		invalid read size 1

!!!!QUOTES!!!!:
echo "$USER'
	ms:	caigner'
	bash: dquote

signale-> im laufenden Porzess mit strg + \
	-> core dumped

bei ; evtl nen syntax error, wenn nicht in quotes?

ls | cat << stop | ls -la | cat << stop1 | ls | cat << stop2 | ls -la > > out | cat << stop3
	->syntax error, so it should not look for later commands any more, at least bash does it like that




CHRIS:

<file1 <file2 <file3 wc >file4
		->bash: file2: Permission denied
		->ms: 	nothing

no such file or dir -> should be command not found

	lexer_new.c cases:
	export T="l"
	$Ts -a
			-> Invalid read of size 1;   nothing happens, exitcode 0
			bash: -a command not found; exit 127

./ls
"./"ls
"./""ls"
"./"''"ls"
		->should not output ls

unset PATH
cd /bin/../bin/../bin/../bin/../bin/../bin/../bin/../bin/
../bin/../bin/ls
		-> bash executes ls in bin...
		-> ms cmd not found

<wc -l
	exitcode:127 ist falsch

IMPLEMENT:
only Redirect 	-> does not create file so far
	-> check if redir is a directory

ls > src
	prints ls. should say src is a directory.

cd --
	ms:	double error message
	bash:	egal

cd ..
	wrong

Set the $PATH to a multiple directory value
(directory1:directory2) and ensure that directories 
are checked in order from left to right.
