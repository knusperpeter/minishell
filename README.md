Here's a step-by-step guide to the project:

1. **Understand the basics of shells**: Before you begin coding, it's crucial to understand what a shell is and how it works. A shell provides a convenient text interface to interact with your system.

2. **Set up your development environment**: Choose a suitable IDE or text editor for writing your code. You'll also need to ensure that your computer has the necessary libraries and tools installed to build and run your shell [Source 0].

3. **Create the lexer**: The lexer, also known as the tokenizer, breaks down the input into tokens. This process is often straightforward.

4. **Develop the parser**: Parsing is a complex process. You need to understand how to use techniques such as recursive descent to parse the input. Recursive descent involves breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems until a solution can be found.

5. **Define the grammar**: The grammar of your shell defines how commands and expressions should be structured. For this project, you'll likely use Context-Free Grammar (CFG).

6. **Handle redirections**: Redirections involve opening a file and then redirecting the standard input or standard output to that file. In the case of a here-doc, you redirect the standard input to a pipe.

7. **Implement built-in commands**: Built-in commands are functions that are included in the shell itself, such as `echo`. These commands can range from simple to complex.

8. **Handle signals**: Your shell should respond appropriately to certain signals, such as `ctrl + C`, `ctrl + \`, and `ctrl + D`. For these signals, you'll need to catch `SIGINT` and `SIGQUIT`, and check for `EOF` or the end of string (`NULL` character) in the case of `ctrl + D`.

9. **Test your shell**: Finally, thoroughly test your shell to ensure it behaves as expected. Be prepared to handle edge cases and potential errors.
