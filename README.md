# üêö Minishell

A simplified bash-like shell implementation. This project is part of the 42 school curriculum and aims to provide a basic understanding of how shells work by implementing core shell functionalities.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notice to 42 Students
This repository serves as a reference. Please:
- Understand the code before using it
- Don't copy without comprehension
- Use it to learn concepts, not to bypass learning

## ‚ú® Features

### Core Functionality
- Interactive command prompt
- Command history navigation
- Path-based executable search
- Environment variable management
- Signal handling
- Exit status tracking (`$?`)

### Input/Output Operations
| Operation | Symbol | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Input Redirection | `<` | Redirect input from file |
| Output Redirection | `>` | Redirect output to file |
| Here Document | `<<` | Read input until delimiter |
| Append Output | `>>` | Append output to file |
| Pipe | `\|` | Connect commands |

### Built-in Commands
| Command | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `echo` | `-n` | Display text |
| `cd` | - | Change directory |
| `pwd` | - | Print working directory |
| `export` | - | Set environment variables |
| `unset` | - | Remove environment variables |
| `env` | - | Display environment |
| `exit` | - | Exit the shell |

### Signal Handling
